## [v3][3.0.0]

This version is a huge reinvention of toot. The name was changed to Share₂Fedi,
as to indicate that sharing to other federated networks is now possible.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

Share₂Fedi is now an [Astro](https://astro.build/) site. The migration allowed
us to have a performant service that is easily hostable on both serverless
platforms, like Vercel or Netlify, as well as locally. Setting the project up
now takes seconds! This comes with changes, though:

- **static files aren't built any more**, but generated server-side
- **new output directory**: ~~`public/`~~ → `dist/`
  - this also means that `public/` **is not ignored any more**

Some changes came with the name change:

- **changed API endpoint path**: ~~`/api/toot`~~ → `/`
  - just send a POST request instead of a GET request with the same body

### Added

- **new federated social networks**
  - Friendica
  - GNU Social
  - Hubzilla
  - Misskey (+ flavours)
- **new ways to host**
  - Netlify
  - Cloudflare Pages
- **multilingual share page**
  - Share₂Fedi can be used in English, French, German, Russian, and Spanish.
    [Help us with other languages!](./src/i18n/translations.ts)
- remembering of multiple Fediverse instances
- new API endpoints
  - `/api/instances` will return the list of popular instances
  - `/api/detect/[host]` will detect the Fediverse project used by a host
- a privacy policy describing what data is being processed and stored
- a link to the status page

### Changed

- **new project name**: Share₂Fedi (see
  [GH#24](https://github.com/kytta/share2fedi/issues/24))
  - new default instance URL: <https://s2f.kytta.dev>
  - new logo
  - new design
- repository moved back to GitHub
- licence of the project is now AGPL v3 **only**
  - for now, this has no effect. If AGPL v4 ever comes out, Share₂Fedi v2 will
    not be available under it
- s2f is now being built with Astro
  - Share₂Fedi is now 100% server-side rendered. You don't have to host any
    static files, all you need is to run the Node server.
  - when developing, the API endpoint can now be tested locally
